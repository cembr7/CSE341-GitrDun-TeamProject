//example
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { add } from "../math.js";

describe("add function", () => {
  it("should return 3 when adding 1 and 2", () => {
    expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
    // use .only to run only specified test 
  it.only('should return 3 when adding 1 and 2', () => {
    expect(add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
  });
  // Skipped test example
  it.skip('should return 0 when adding -1 and 1', () => {
    expect(add(-1, 1)).toBe(0);
  });
});

//documentation
The describe function organizes related tests within a test suite, providing a clear structure to the test file.

Within this suite, the it function defines individual test cases, each specifying a particular behavior to verify.

To ensure correctness, the expect function performs assertions, checking whether add(1, 2) returns 3 as expected.

//setup and teardown
use beforeEach, afterEach, beforeAll, afterAll

Using beforeEach, you can automate repetitive tasks such as resetting mocks or initializing resources. This leads to cleaner, more organized, and maintainable test code.

Beyond beforeEach, Vitest offers additional hooks—afterEach, beforeAll, and afterAll. These allow you to execute setup and teardown logic either before or after a group of tests, rather than for each individual test. This is especially useful when working with shared resources like database connections, ensuring efficient setup and cleanup.

For instance, when testing database operations, you can use beforeAll to establish a connection once before any tests run and afterAll to close the connection once all tests have completed:

//database example
describe("Database operations", () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Establish database connection
    await db.connect();
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    // Close the database connection after all tests
    await db.disconnect();
  });

  // Your tests here...
});

This allows for a detailed coverage report

// ui testing
launch and test in the ui

//running tests
// To run the tests, use the command: npm test
// Filtering tests by command line options:
// - To run tests with names matching a specific pattern, use the --testNamePattern option: 
//   example: npm test -- -t "add function"
//   example2: npm test -- -t "should return 5"
